# RecNetBotV2
A Discord bot that utilizes RecNet's API!

RecNetBot is a Discord bot, that utilizes RecNet's API in fun ways. It's designed to keep you away from https://rec.net as much as possible, since it's sometimes a complete pain in the ass to visit, because of its slow performance. 

Let's say you want to show off a nice picture you shared on RecNet to your friends. Instead of going to https://rec.net, searching up your profile, loading up the images tab, and downloading/copying the image link, while also dealing with the painfully long loading times, you can just do `.latest Jegarde`! It's a huge time saver in many situations, and that's just one example.

This bot is a must have for any Rec Room related server out there.

# Stuff you can do with this bot
- Get your RecNet statistics!
- Check your room statistics, and how they have changed since last check!
- Go through the frontpage or someone's posts with a menu using reactions!
- Sort your posts!
- Get images based on many parameters! (e.g images with someone else)
- Random bios/images/rooms/images of you/images taken by you, and many more!
- Search events!
- And much, MUCH more!

You can try out the 50+ commands in the testing channels here! (#test, #test2, #test3) Use the command `.help` to get you started!
 
If you have any suggestions for the bot, such as command ideas, ways to make the bot better in general, etc; feel free to let me know in the Discord server!

The source code is quite messy, but I hope you can get something out of it. :P
